[Verse 1]
How could ignore  ?
Trust  adore  
We’re swimming through our dreams
Kiss  in the shower
For a couple hours
Though we’re only sixteen
  sit down beside me
Don’t call  daddy
Cause  ’s just fucking weird
Promise    'll stay here
    can lay here
Until the end of time

[Chorus]
But girl, well don't   worry about me
It ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely (Darling)
Girl, don't worry about me
But if  ’re ever unhappy
Then maybe, baby, must let   go
Let   go

[Verse 2]
Baby, now it’s best here, to lay  down   rest here
Let’s dream of Corduroy
Work for what   love to do   will watch right over  
With  r heart, I’ll never toy
   ’re the other half of me
Drink   sleep   laugh with me
Save  from myself
See I’m a fucking basket-case
Until I'm able to see  r face
  saved  from myself

[Chorus]
But girl, don't worry about me
Cause it ain't new to me, feeling this lonely
Darling baby, girl, don't worry about me
Cause if  're ever unhappy, if  ’re ever unhappy
If  ’re ever, ever unhappy
Then maybe, maybe baby must let   go



[Intro]
Ay

[Hook: Rex Orange County]
When we first spent the night
Nothing else would ever feel   way
In my room it all changed

[Chorus: Rex Orange County]
  could see something in  r eyes
I knew   nothing else would be the same
But wish   could grow up, the way in which   grow up
'Cause then  'd never see  cry
  I'd feel like a better guy
'Cause nothing, nothing
Oh, nothing, no
I said,   nothing else would ever be the same

[Hook: Rex Orange County]
When we first spent the night
No, nothing else could ever feel   way
In my room it all changed, yeah

[Verse 1: Marco McKinnis]
Nothing seems to be as floral as  , baby
A scarlet love   dew-light touches were so sacred
I could never leave  r face
Shower   with my warm embrace, baby

[Chorus: Rex Orange County]
  still see   in  r eyes
I hope   nothing will ever change
'Cause wish   could grow up, the way in which   grow up
'Cause then I'd love myself   I, I'd feel like a better guy
'Cause nothing, no, nothing
No, nothing, no
I said,   nothing else would ever be the same
Same, same, same (Be the same)

[Verse 2: Rex Orange County]
'Cause lately I've been missing  
  just kinda want  r body (I want it, baby)
I know could ease the pain (Ease the pain)
  know   done missed  too,   if  's true, well I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
But at least I'm on my feet again (I'm on my feet again)
But listen, girl
Couldn't   tell I'm scared as well?
  could hold my h  (Say something, say something)
Say something, something   could ease my pain
Ease my pain

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh



[Intro]
Oh
I want to know
Where can go
When  're not around
  I'm feeling down
So won't   stay for a moment
So can say
I, need   so
'Cause right now   know   nothing here's new
  I'm obsessed with  
Then fell to the ground
    smiled at    said

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna see   cry
  don't have to feel this emptiness
She said love   till the day   die
Well, maybe she's right
'Cause don't wanna feel like I'm not me
  to be honest don't even know why
I let myself get down in the first place

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes

[Verse 2]
  know   need to get  rself to sleep   dream
A dream of     I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for  
Just let  hold   in these arms tonight
I'm lucky to be      can see it in my face
Back when fucked my shit up too many times
Why would let myself get down in the first place?

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down, down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes

[Bridge]
  so she sat  down   told    didn't have to cry
Said didn't need to get down or feel empty inside
  told    she'll love  for as long as she's alive
  well, maybe she's right
'Cause hate it when feel like I'm not me
See, honestly don't even know why
I-I honestly don't even know why

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes



[Verse 1]
Now there's no one left to blame
   r face stays the same
 're ashamed to say   feel relieved
Stay away from  r own family

[Pre-Chorus]
But years from now
If   could make them proud
  could leave the world   feel like  've
Achieved the things   hoped to do, but
Honestly, don't feel ordinary 'cause haven't been at home in a while
Tell them   it's only temporary, I'm trying my best to smile

[Chorus]
But  's never enough
'Cause when   lose the ones   love
  might find it hard to cry
Until it's only     everybody else has left the room
  might feel what it's like to not know how to feel

[Verse 2]
  see, my old lady's old man just now left
  there's nothing can say except this long awaited rest
Is a good thing,   all good things must come to an end
It's right in front of  so there's no reason to pretend
Except, I'm afraid to die
If this were a movie,  'd be taking our kids to school
  would be Channing Tatum or somebody sexy, somebody cool

[Pre-Chorus]
But years from now
If   could make them proud
  could leave the world   feel like  've
Achieved the things   hoped to do, cause
Honestly, don't feel ordinary 'cause haven't left my house in a while
Tell them   it's only temporary, I'm trying my best to smile

[Chorus]
But  's never enough
'Cause when   lose the ones   love
  might find it hard to cry
Until it's only     everybody else has left the room
  might feel what it's like to not know how to feel

[Breakdown]
Don't tell   're sorry
 're just sorry for  rself
  though   may seem fine alone
Well could be the one to help
No, don't tell   're sorry
 're just sorry for  rself
  though   may seem fine alone
I wanna be the one to help
No, don't tell   're sorry
 're just sorry for  rself
  though   may seem fine alone
I wanna be the one to help
Don't tell   're sorry
 're just sorry for  rself
  though   may seem fine alone
I wanna be the one to help
Don't tell   're sorry
 're just sorry for  rself
  though   may seem fine alone
I wanna be the one to help
Don't tell   're sorry
 're just sorry for  rself
  though   may seem fine alone
I hope to be the one to help



[Chorus]
Loving is easy
  had  fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah, loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen, girl
When   can't even hide it
  it didn't take forever to find it
I was all on my own
Almost glad to be alone
Until love came in on time, on time

[Chorus]
So loving is easy
  had  fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah, loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Ah, ah
Oh, oh
Ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
So listen, girl
When   can't even hide it
  it didn't take forever to find it
I was all on my own
Almost glad to be alone
Until love came in on time, oh, on time

[Chorus]
Loving is easy
  had  fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah, loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Ah, ah
Oh, oh
Ah, ah



[Verse]
I'll be the one   stays 'till the end
  I'll be the one   needs   again
  I'll be the one   proposes in a garden of roses
  truly loves   long after our curtain closes
But will   still love  when nobody wants  around?
When turn 81   forget things, will   still be proud?
'Cause am the one  's waited this long
  am the one   might get it wrong
  I'll be the one   will love   the way I'm supposed to, girl, oh
But will   still love  when nobody wants  around, around?
When turn 81   forget things, will   still be proud?
Proud of    my short list of accomplishments, say
   my lack of new news
Me   my selfishness, oh,    myself
Wish   nothing but a happy new version of  
Because I, mmm, mmm, yeah
I want   to tell    find it hard to be  rself so can say
""It's gonna be alright"", yeah
  want   to love  the way   love  r family
The way   love to show  what it's like
To be happy



[Intro]
I should've stayed at home
'Cause right now see all these people   love me
But still feel alone
Can't help but check my phone
I could've made   mine
But no, it wasn't meant to be   see wasn't made for  
    weren't made for me
Though it seemed so easy

[Chorus]
   's because wanna be  r favorite boy
I wanna be the one   makes  r day
The one   think about as   lie awake
I can't wait to be  r number one
I'll be  r biggest fan    'll be mine
But still wanna break  r heart   make   cry

[Verse]
But won't   wait?
  know it's too late
I'm on my own shit now
Let  tell   how it feels to be fucking great
I feel great
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
  need to be  rself
Love someone for loving   instead of someone really cool
  makes  r heart melt
Who knows what   truly felt
 're still my favorite girl
  better trust  when tell   there ain't no one else
More beautiful in this damn world
In this damn world

[Bridge]
 're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
 're gonna wanna be my best friend
I said  
 're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
 're gonna wanna be my best friend
 're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
 're gonna wanna be my best friend
Best friend
 're gonna wanna be my best friend baby
 're gonna wanna be my best friend

But no, no, no, no
No, no, no, oh

[Chorus]
I still wanna be  r favorite boy
I wanna be the one   makes  r day
The one   think about as   lie awake
  can't wait to be  r number,  r number one
I'll be  r biggest fan    'll be mine
But still wanna break  r heart   make   cry

[Outro]
I still wanna be  r favorite boy
I wanna be the one
I might just be the one

'Cause baby there's something   know
But clearly   say, I'm not good for

One time had love for  

[Chorus]
'Cause honestly,   got  gone
From everyone

It's not working right now
Say   we're lovers
  we miss our mothers again
She don't really like  
Boy kind of like  
  don't really like to mention   to me
Tell em write a haiku cuz
No one really likes me
I'm getting used to  

Days by, baby don't got no brake lights
My car turns off when go fast
Why would   want me
Days by, baby don't got no brake lights
My car turns off when go fast
Why would   want me

Days by, I'm losing the sunrise
I'll fall close to  
Losing my mind

","

[Chorus: Braeden]
 r way
I'm trying to underst  these days
I need to know if  're feeling it
Or if I'm wasting my time
 r way, or mine?

[Verse 1: Dylan]
  spend every second with him
 're taking what  're given
 r mother don't approve of the way    've been living
She says he puts   through it
  shouldn't let him do it
  if there is a voice in  r head, don't listen to it

[Verse 2: Braeden]
My mind is open wide
I think of it a thous  times
  empty space left in my bed from when   stayed the night
We were fucked up, but   still made sure slept on my side
I still wake up wishing  're there when open my eyes

[Chorus: Braeden]
 r way
I'm trying to underst  these days
I need to know if  're feeling it, or I'm wasting my time
 r way, or mine?

[Bridge: Dylan & Braeden]
Spend every second with him
 're taking what  're given

She says he puts   through it
(My mind is open wide)

(I think of it a thous  times)
  if there is a voice in  r
(  empty space left in my)
Head don't listen to it

[Outro: Braeden & Dylan]

I'm trying to underst  these days
I need to know if  're feeling it
Or I'm wasting my time

[Verse 1: Dylan]
 're talking while  're fast asleep
As walk slowly from  r house
Back in  r room remain the words wanna say to  
But couldn't leave my mouth
Does it come as a surprise?
Language of averted eyes
Silence is what do best

[Pre-Chorus: Dylan]
Still, hear it all
Wasting time around my head
So talk to myself instead

[Chorus: Braeden]
Sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say   want it right now
But wouldn't know how
It's something   can't do
Then what am supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only could please her

[Verse 2: Braeden]
Indecisive feelings of enjoyment
Hold the thought, think need a moment
I'm aware there's somethin' should tell  
But my voice annoys me
Bite my tongue off with a smile
I can't feel it anymore
'Cause recently the line is blurred
Between depression   bliss

[Pre-Chorus: Braeden]
Now see   the times don't change
They waste away
But just wanna sleep today
  don't wanna talk to   right now
  say

[Chorus: Braeden]
But, I'm sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say   want it right now
But wouldn't know how
It's something   can't do
Then what am supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only could please her

[Bridge: Dylan & Braeden]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Dylan & Braeden]
I'm talking while  're next to me
Did ruin the moment?
If could tell   how feel
Would   know what the words meant?
For sake of conversation
Could   read the writings on my sleeve?
'Cause  's the best  're gonna get
So maybe had better leave



[Verse 1]
Thought saw  r shadow under the door
Just a trick of the light I've seen before
I can never tell what's real anymore
Anymore, anymore

[Verse 2]
I remember when we ran from the pool
All the decorations up in  r room
  couldn't find the right words to use
But knew     knew

[Pre-Chorus]
It's seemed so long, it's seemed so long
The moments   stay, they turn out all wrong
When look around,  're gone

[Chorus 1]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
All the places return to
All the faces   remind  

[Chorus 2]
I can still see   at the place know when close my eyes
Do   remember when we felt like the only two alive?
Don't let  be one of the people   seek a lost romance
Would   go   do it all over again, given the chance?

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh



[Verse 1]
Could trust   with my thoughts
Or would   use them all against me
Can   replace my eyes for  rs
  see what really look like
I could help   criticize

[Chorus 1]
Looking for a sense of relation
Where do people want  to be?
I can't help but cry on vacation
Dressed to un-impress easily
Losing sight again
I'll go ahead   give  r eyes back now

[Verse 2]
  grow up, gone
So what's the point of connecting to anyone?
Is a relationship bought or is it won?

[Chorus 2]
Are the things think are important
Simply just distractions from death?
All of my ideas turn to content
They can be conceived 'til they're read
Lost my words again
It doesn't matter
'Cause   wouldn't underst 

[Chorus 3]
Love in teens   life in the twenties
Nothing much to look forward to
I can't help but cry on vacation
Is this the way to exit my  th?
Oh

[Outro]
Hey, treacherous doctor, do   know what's the matter with me?
Hey, treacherous doctor, do   know what's the matter with me?



[Verse 1: Braeden]
New ways to spend all my time
Some's gone   some doesn't feel right
I need a new place to stay
  don't think I'm gonna find it
  say   want, but never will
Just take it back   tell  no
It's easier to be alone
Than to be lied to

[Chorus: Braeden]
Why'd   waste all the time?
Back   forth in my mind
Clean it out, tell  now
Was it worth all the doubt?
 're not here with me, dear
Can we go through the years?
Take   there every night
Say   it's only right

[Verse 2: Dylan]
White noise   plays in my head
Try to recall the words   said
Can   slip into my dreams?
  then I'll never wanna wake up
I hear   talk when  're not there
It comes at  from everywhere
Oh, can   lose the rest of me
  take my mind away?

[Chorus: Braeden]
Why'd   waste all the time
Back   forth in my mind
Clean it out, tell  now
Was it worth all the doubt?
 're not here, with  dear
Can we go, through the years?
Take   there, every night
Say   it's only right

[Bridge: Dylan & Braeden]
I'm wide awake, it feels like all the time
I need to know if it'll be alright
I'm waiting on another day to fall
When  're awake to hear my call
'Cause it's open
I'm wide awake, it feels like all the time (My door is open)
I need to know if it'll be alright
(Please let  know when)
I'm waiting on another day to fall  ( 're coming home)
When  're awake to hear my call

[Chorus: Braeden]
Why'd   waste all the time
Back   forth in my mind
Clean it out, tell  now
Was it worth all the doubt?
 're not here, with  dear
Can we go, through the years?
Take   there, every night
Say   it's only right



[Verse 1: Dylan Minnette with Clairo]
What's wrong?
 've been asking but don't have an answer
How come?
I'm still thinking, let's pretend to fall asleep now
When we get old, will we regret this?
Too  ng to think about all   shit
  stalling only goes so far when  've got a head start

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette with Clairo]
'Cause we could stay at home   watch the sunset
But can't help from asking, ""Are   bored yet?""
  if  're feeling lonely   should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will   tell the truth so don't have to lie?
Will   tell the truth so don't have to lie?

[Verse 2: Clairo]
Feels like I've known   my whole life
I can see right through  r lies
I don't know where we're going
But I'd like to be by  r side
If   could tell  how  're feeling
Maybe we'd get through this undefeated
Holding on for so long

[Chorus: Dylan Minnette with Clairo]
'Cause we could stay at home   watch the sunset
But can't help from asking, ""Are   bored yet?""
  if  're feeling lonely   should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will   tell the truth so don't have to lie?
Will   tell the truth so don't have to lie?



[Verse 1: Dylan]
I see the end,   wait for nothing
    I, we grew up in the suburbs
Now  're gone, the city's down a number
It is not the same without   around, oh

[Verse 2: Dylan]
I see   there, still shy but smiling
Now find it hard to remember
All the times I've tried to forget her
I am hanging on to something real

[Chorus: Dylan & Braeden]
'Cause pictures of girls are not for me
  see

[Bridge: Dylan & Braeden]
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood

[Outro: Dylan & Braeden]
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood
(I'd like to see it all)
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood
(I'd like to see it all)
  should be down in Hollywood
  should be down in Hollywood

[Verse 1]
I never thought   would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn,   got  in love again
I used to think   was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew had it in  to dance anymore
But goddamn,   got  in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show    heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so know I'm not crazy

  got  in love again
  got  in love again

But goddamn,   got  in love again

Show    heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so know I'm not crazy
Never have ever met somebody like

[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love   lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what like
Now I'm falling
  say my name like have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one   feels it all
Are   falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
  know   can get whatever   want from me
Whenever   want it, baby
It's   in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause was doing better alone
But when   said, ""Hello""
I knew   was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting   go
Am falling in love with the one   could break my heart?
Oh no, was doing better alone
But when   said, ""Hello""
I knew   was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting   go
Am falling in love with the one   could break my heart?

[Verse 2]
I wonder, when   go, if stay on  r mind
Two can play   game, but   win  every time
Everyone before   was a waste of time
Yeah,   got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
  know   can get whatever   want from me
Whenever   want it, baby
It's   in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause was doing better alone
But when   said, ""Hello""
I knew   was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting   go
Am falling in love with the one   could break my heart?
Oh no, was doing better alone
But when   said, ""Hello""
I knew   was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting   go
Am falling in love with the one   could break my heart?

[Bridge]
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am falling in love with the one   could break my heart?

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause was doing better alone
But when   said, ""Hello""
I knew   was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting   go
Am falling in love with the one   could break my heart?
Oh no (Oh no), was doing better alone
But when   said, ""Hello""
I knew   was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting   go
Am falling in love with the one   could break my heart?

[Verse 1]
Don't do love, don't do friends
I'm only after success
Don't need a relationship
I'll never soften my grip

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want cash, don't want card
Want it fast, want it hard
Don't need money, don't need fame
I just want to make a change
I just wanna change, just wanna change
I just wanna change, just wanna change
I just wanna... change

[Chorus]
I know exactly what want   who want to be
I know exactly why walk   talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!

One track mind, one track heart
If fail, I'll fall apart
Maybe it is all a test
'Cause feel like I'm the worst
So always act like I'm the best

[Pre-Chorus]
If   are not very careful
 r possessions will possess  
TV taught  how to feel
Now real life has no appeal
It has no appeal, it has no appeal
It has no appeal, it has no appeal
It has no appeal

[Verse 1]
The pagodas   the palaces
Dressed in gold leaf, hide the damages
Spot the Geisha as she balances
Life's a cakewalk, full of challenges
Go to Russia, see the Red Square
Lenin's body lying dead there
From Kyoto, Hiroshima
Watch the black cloud crawling nearer

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There were riots in America
Just when things were getting better
All the things I've done   seen
Still don't know what life means

[Chorus]
All the people living in, living in the world today
We're united by our love, we're united by our pain (Ooh)
All the things   I've done   I've seen
Still, don't know, don't know what it means

[Verse 2]
Fly to Athens, pass the Parthenon
See the village where my father's from
To Chicago from Angola
São Paulo to Verona

[Pre-Chorus 2]
  anywhere   go,  'll see (Ooh)
People are just like    (Ooh)
All the things I've done   seen
Still, don't know what life means

All the people living in, living in the world today
We're united by our love, we're united by our pain (Ooh)
All the things   I've done   I've seen
Still, don't know, don't know what it means
To be human
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Still, don't know, don't know what it means
To be human, a real human being

[Bridge]
I like to think about how we all look from afar
People driving fancy cars look like beetles to the stars
The missiles   the bombs sound like symphonies gone wrong
  if there is a God, they'll know why it's so hard

[Chorus]
To be human
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
To be human
Still, don't know, don't know what it means
To be human, a real human being

I want connection, ooh
I wanna feel human again
(To be human)
Lost my direction, ooh
I wanna feel human again
To be human, to be human
To be human, to be human

American queen is the American dream
American queen is the American dream

She is a Polish girl in America
Tall, tanned, hot blonde called Anya
I asked her, ""Why would   wanna be a Hollywood wife?""
""Because don't want to end up living in a dive on Vine""

Crosswords on a flight to JFK
Thirty-nine years old with a mile-high sheen
Trying to stimulate a mind

I itch my skin, jump up   say
""Lady, know why  r thoughts turn grey""

[Alternative Pre-Chorus]
 'd do anything for a dime

I'm obsessed with the mess  's America

[Verse 3]
A fat security making plays for me
Soon as touch down in old L.A
He said, ""Oh, my god,   look just like Shakira
No, no,  're Catherine Zeta!""
""Actually, my name's Marina""

[Pre-Chorus]
 r mind is just like mine
All filled up with things benign

Used to be a major scale
But the melody went stale
Musical cacophony let
Insy winsy spider free
 're a rich little boy
Who's had to work for his toys
 've got all the sensibilities, oh
Of an upper class guy

No, no, I'm not  r little slave
No, don't twist   turn   way
Only got bad things to say

Could never tell   what happened
The day turned seventeen
The rise of a king   the fall of a queen, oh
Seventeen
Seventeen

[Verse 2]
Oh,   were embarrassed of me
'Cause used my tongue freely
Bet   wish couldn't speak, 'cause when do

Go get  r upper class wife
Oh, she's got all the personality, oh
Of a lemon   has been
Truly sucked dry

[Pre-Chorus]
  teach  how to behave
I felt   question the way
I was brought up as a baby
Well,   don't know fuck about my family

Could never tell   what happened

Never felt like a princess

Were meant to be
Oh, seventeen

[Verse 1]
I've seen seasons come   go
From winter sun to summer snow
This ain't my first time at the rodeo

[Verse 2]
Nature ain't a fruit machine
She's gotta keep her credits clean
Good things come to those who wait
But ain't in a patient phase

[Interlude 1]
It's summer time   hang on the vine
They're gonna make  into sweet red wine
Hanging around like a fruit on a tree
Waiting to be picked, come on cut  free

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Come on fill  r cup up
Looking for some good luck
Good luck, good luck to  
Hanging like a fruit
Ready to be juiced
Juiced, juiced

[Chorus]
Living la dolce vita
Life couldn't get much sweeter
Don't   give  a reason
  it's not the right season
Babe, love   a lot
I'll give   all I've got
Yeah,   know   it's true
I've been saving all my summers for  
I've been saving all my summers for  
Like froot, like froot

[Verse 3]
Baby, am plump   ripe
I'm pinker than shepherd's delight
Sweet like honeysuckle late at night

[Verse 4]
Leave it too long I'll go rot
Like an apple   forgot
Birds   worms will come for me
The cycle of life is complete

[Interlude 2]
I'm  r carnal flower, I'm  r bloody rose
Pick my petals off   make my heart explode
I'm  r deadly nightshade, I'm  r cherry tree
 're my one true love, I'm  r destiny

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Come on fill  r cup up
Looking for some good luck
Good luck, good luck to  
Autumn, I'll be gone
Birds will sing their mourning song
Song

[Chorus]
Living la dolce vita
Life couldn't get much sweeter
Don't   give  a reason
  it's not the right season
Babe, love   a lot
I'll give   all I've got
Yeah,   know   it's true
I've been saving all my summers for  
I've been saving all my summers for  
Like froot, like froot

[Bridge]
Oh my body is ready
Yeah it's ready, yeah it's ready for  r love
Oh my branches are heavy
Yeah they're heavy, yeah they're heavy

[Chorus]
Living la dolce vita
Life couldn't get much sweeter
Don't   give  a reason
  it's not the right season
Babe, love   a lot
I'll give   all I've got
Yeah,   know   it's true
I've been saving all my summers for  
I've been saving all my summers for  
Like froot, like froot

[Outro]
Living la dolce vita
I'm in love
Living la dolce vita
I'm in love
I'm in love



[Chorus]
Primadonna girl, yeah
All ever wanted was the world
I can't help   need it all
The primadonna life, the rise   fall
  say   I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got   wrapped around my finger, babe
  can count on  to misbehave
Primadonna girl

[Verse 1]
Would   do anything for me?
Buy a big diamond ring for me?
Would   get down on  r knees for me?
Pop   pretty question right now, baby
Beauty queen on a silver screen
Living life like I'm in a dream
I know I've got a big ego
I really don't know why it's such a big deal though

[Refrain 1]
(Ooh)   I'm sad to the core, core, core
(Yeah) Every day is a chore, chore, chore
(Wow) When   give, want more, more, more
I wanna be adored

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a Primadonna girl, yeah
All ever wanted was the world
I can't help   need it all
The primadonna life, the rise   fall
  say   I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got   wrapped around my finger, babe
  can count on  to misbehave
Primadonna girl

[Verse 2]
Fill the void up with celluloid
Take a picture, I'm with the boys
Get what want 'cause ask for it
Not because I'm really   deserving of it
Living life like I'm in a play
In the limelight want to stay
I know I've got a big ego
I really don't know why it's such a big deal though

[Refrain 2]
(Ooh) Going up, going down, down, down
(Yeah) Anything for the crown, crown, crown
(Wow) When the lights dimming down, down, down
I spin around

[Bridge]
'Cause I'm a Primadonna girl, yeah
All ever wanted was the world
I can't help   need it all
The primadonna life, the rise   fall
  say   I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got   wrapped around my finger, babe
  can count on  to misbehave

[Chorus]
Primadonna girl, yeah
All ever wanted was the world
I can't help   need it all
The primadonna life, the rise   fall
  say   I'm kinda difficult
But it's always someone else's fault
Got   wrapped around my finger, babe
  can count on  to misbehave
Primadonna girl



[Verse 1]
 're never gonna love me, so what's the use?
What's the point in playing a game  're gonna lose?
What's the point in saying   love  like a friend?
What's the point in saying it's never gonna end?

[Pre-Chorus]
 're too proud to say     made a mistake
 're a coward till the end
I don't wanna admit   we're not gonna fit
No, I'm not the type     like
Why don't we just pretend?

[Chorus]
Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh
I can't let   go, can't let   go, oh
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight
Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh

[Verse 2]
  only ever touch  in the dark
Only if we're drinking can   see my spark
  only in the evening could   give  rself to me
'Cause the night is  r woman,   she'll set   free

[Pre-Chorus]
 're too proud to say     made a mistake
 're a coward till the end
I don't wanna admit   we're not gonna fit
No, I'm not the type     like
Why don't we just pretend?

[Chorus]
Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh
I can't let   go, can't let   go, oh
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight
Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh

[Bridge]
(Ooh)
(Lie-ee-i-ee-ies)

[Chorus]
Lies
Don't wanna know, don’t wanna know, oh
I can't let   go, can't let   go, oh
I just want it to be perfect
To believe it's all been worth the fight
Lies
Don't wanna know, don't wanna know, oh



[Verse 1: Marilyn Monroe]
Every boyfriend is the one
Until otherwise proven
The good are never easy, the easy never good
  love, it never happens like   think it really should
Deception   perfection are wonderful traits
One will breed love, the other, hate
 'll find  in the lonely hearts
Under 'I'm after a br  new start'

[Pre-Chorus: MARINA]
  don't belong to anyone

[Chorus 1: MARINA]
They call  homewrecker, homewrecker
They call  homewrecker, homewrecker

[Verse 2: Marilyn Monroe]
Girls   their curls   their gourmet vomit
Boys   their toys   their six inch rockets
We're all very lovely 'til we get to know each other
As we stop becoming friends   we start becoming lovers

[Pre-Chorus: MARINA]
  don't belong to anyone

[Chorus 2: MARINA]
They call  homewrecker, homewrecker
(I'm only happy when I'm on the run)
They call  homewrecker, homewrecker
(I broke a million hearts just for fun)
They call  homewrecker, homewrecker
(I'm only happy when I'm on the run)
They call  homewrecker, homewrecker
(I broke a million hearts just for fun)

[Bridge: MARINA]
I'm only happy when I'm on the run
I break a million hearts just for fun
I don't belong to anyone
I guess   could say   my life's a mess
But I'm still looking pretty in this dress
I'm the image of deception

[Verse 3: Marilyn Monroe]
When everything is life   death
  may feel like there's nothing left
Instead of love   trust   laughter
What   get is happy never after
But deep down all   want is love
The pure kind we all dream of
But we cannot escape the past
So     will never last

[Chorus: MARINA]
'Cause I'm a homewrecker, homewrecker
(I'm only happy when I'm on the ru-u-un)
'Cause I'm a homewrecker, homewrecker
(I break a million hearts just for fu-u-un)
'Cause I'm a homewrecker, homewrecker
(I'm only happy when I'm on the ru-u-un)
'Cause I'm a homewrecker, homewrecker
(I break a million hearts just for fu-u-un)

[Outro: MARINA]
'Cause I'm a homewrecker, homewrecker

[Verse 1]
I feel close
Well, maybe I'm not, heaven knows
It's a spotlight stuck on the ceiling
Why are these the things   I'm feeling?
There's so much time
For  to speak up, but keep quiet
I'll complicate the most of the mantra
The power's out   can't turn the fan on

[Chorus]
So can call   tonight?
I'm trying to make up my mind
Just how feel
Could   tell  what's real?
I hear  r voice on the phone
Now I'm no longer alone
Just how feel
Could   tell  what's real anymore?
'Cause wouldn't know

[Verse 2]
Voice so low
Sneaking around, so it goes
I always try my best to listen
Picking up things   can fidget
Circle speed
Pacing around, watching my feet
Batteries drain, get the memo
""I think   might have to let   go""

[Chorus]
So can call   tonight?
I'm trying to make up my mind
Just how feel
Could   tell  what's real?
I hear  r voice on the phone
Now I'm no longer alone
Just how feel
Could   tell  what's real anymore?
'Cause wouldn't know

[Bridge]
(We're sorry;   have reached a number   has been disconnected or is no longer in service)
(If   feel   have reached this recording in error please check the number   try  r call again)
Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, don't go   leave me
Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, don't go   leave me
Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, don't go   leave me
Don't go, don't go so easy
Don't go, go

[Chorus]
So can call   tonight?
I'm trying to make up my mind
Just how feel
Could   tell  what's real?
I hear  r voice on the phone
Now I'm no longer alone
Just how feel
Could   tell  what's real anymore?
'Cause wouldn't know



[Intro - Spoken]
Sloan, let's sing a song, what should we sing?

[Verse 1]
My memory is not like the other one
Turn to strike my face
Always second place
Tell  again why is it I
Never can do anything right?
Complicated theories of life, sarcastically

[Chorus]
But we both know
The way it's gonna go
In the same way
Maybe I'm not all     thought
  we don't move
Like we used to do
In the same way
Maybe  're not such a hot rod

[Verse 2]
Take back again all   ever was
It was only just a phase
I never thought of it   way
But what do know
I'm sorry for
Not wanting to be  r décor
Truth is such a violent force, pushing   away

[Chorus]
But we both know
The way it's gonna go
In the same way
Maybe I'm not all     thought
  we don't move
Like we used to do
In the same way
Maybe  're not such a hot rod

[Chorus]
But we both know
The way it's gonna go
In the same way
Maybe I'm not all     thought
  we don't move
Like we used to do
In the same way
Maybe  're not such a hot rod



[Verse 1]
I'm broken, between disillusions
Outside the window, noon-day communion
I never understood, kids in the neighborhood
Playing in the front yard, loosely committed
Now as look upon, them in the front lawn
It doesn’t take long for  to get it

[Pre-Chorus]
  oh, (oh), oh, (oh), oh, (oh), I've been losing my mind, for quite some time
  oh, (oh), oh, (oh), oh, (oh), oh, find again,   it has been something I
I've been so untrue, true, true, oh
’Cause, where, (where), where, (where), where, (where), where did lose  ?

[Chorus]
Oh, was something so remarkable
It seems to    she was only in my head
For a moment, told  , lost it
Tornado over conscious
Spinning around the room,   move in ways I'll never underst 
So, my guess, at best is only just a second plan

[Verse 2]
Her fingers were crossed behind her back
Well, they say it's fair game, but don't trust like  
I guess the game we play, is taking different shape
We make up new rules as we go along
  all her other friends
Line up along the fence
I'm in the last draft, as expected

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I've been losing my mind, for quite some time
  oh, (oh), oh, (oh), oh, (oh), oh, find again,   it has been something I
I've been so untrue, true, true, true, oh
'Cause, where, (where), where, (where), where, (where), where did lose  ?

[Chorus]
Oh, was something so remarkable
It seems to    she was only in my head
For a moment, told  , lost it
Tornado over conscious
Spinning around the room,   move in ways I’ll never underst 
So, my guess, at best is only just a second plan

[Bridge]
Oh, can see what’s happening to us
I saw it from a mile away, okay, oh well

[Chorus]
Oh, was something so remarkable
It seems to    she was only in my head
For a moment, told  , lost it
Tornado over conscious
Spinning around the room,   move in ways I'll never underst 
So, my guess, at best, is only just a second plan



[Verse 1]
So pessimistic
So narcissistic
So cynical
Welcome to my own little world
A false commitment
Oh, never listened
  I'm just a problem
  no one's ever solved it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, don't think   could be the one     want  to be
It's hard for  sometimes to see the light inside my love

[Chorus]
I, I, I, want to run the world
I, I, I, want to run the
I, I, I, I, want to run the world, the world, the world, the world
  I, I, I, want to run the world
I, I, I, want to run the
I, I, I, I, want to run the world, the world, the world, the world

[Verse 2]
I'm never honest
I'm faking all this
Just point those fingers
'Cause could never be hurt
I'm not what say
Oh, am so fake
Just an illusion
Props to  r conclusions

[Pre-Chorus 2]
  why is it   believe everything they speak of me?
It's hard for  sometimes to see beyond all   they want

[Chorus]
I, I, I, want to run the world
I, I, I, want to run the
I, I, I, I, want to run the world, the world, the world, the world
  I, I, I, want to run the world
I, I, I, want to run the
I, I, I, I, want to run the world, the world, the world, the world
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, want to run the world, the world, the world, the world
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, want to run the world, the world, the world, the world



[Verse 1]
I stop but then hesitate
What's the point of leaving if we can't even wait?
She's thinking of what she could say

[Pre-Chorus]
Fifteen days   spent
Finding out what   meant
Now we're dancing again
Keeping time, she keeps my eyes awake
What else is there to say?

[Chorus]
(I knew   wouldn't change)
I thought   this was something different than before
Now we're changing shape inside  r brain   starting to reform, oh lord
Now I'm speaking words without thinking before
(I knew   wouldn't change)
I wanted to do what said   I'd do
Now I'm making things up   not thinking it through, so true
It was so legit but it's nothing new
(I knew   wouldn't change)

[Verse 2]
Well, now don't know what to speak
Writing a verse is worse than   think
I'm spitting out her Listerine

[Pre-Chorus]
Fifteen days   spent
Finding out what   meant
Now we're dancing again
Keeping time, she keeps my eyes awake
What else is there to say?

[Chorus]
(I knew   wouldn't change)
I thought   this was something different than before
Now we're changing shape inside  r brain   starting to reform, oh lord
Now I'm speaking words without thinking before
(I knew   wouldn't change)
I wanted to do what said   I'd do
Now I'm making things up   not thinking it through, so true
It was so legit but it's nothing new
(I knew   wouldn't change)
