[Verse 1]
How could I ignore you?
Trust me I adore you
We’re swimming through our dreams
Kiss me in the shower
For a couple hours
Though we’re only sixteen
And sit down beside me
Don’t call me daddy
Cause that’s just fucking weird
Promise that you'll stay here
You and I can lay here
Until the end of time

[Chorus]
But girl, well don't you worry about me
It ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely (Darling)
Girl, don't worry about me
But if you’re ever unhappy
Then maybe, baby, I must let you go
Let you go

[Verse 2]
Baby, now it’s best here, to lay me down and rest here
Let’s dream of Corduroy
Work for what you love to do and I will watch right over you
With your heart, I’ll never toy
And you’re the other half of me
Drink and sleep and laugh with me
Save me from myself
See I’m a fucking basket-case
Until I'm able to see your face
You saved me from myself

[Chorus]
But girl, don't worry about me
Cause it ain't new to me, feeling this lonely
Darling baby, girl, don't worry about me
Cause if you're ever unhappy, if you’re ever unhappy
If you’re ever, ever unhappy
Then maybe, maybe baby I must let you go



[Intro]
Ay

[Hook: Rex Orange County]
When we first spent the night
Nothing else would ever feel that way
In my room it all changed

[Chorus: Rex Orange County]
And I could see something in your eyes
I knew that nothing else would be the same
But I wish that I could grow up, the way in which you grow up
'Cause then you'd never see me cry
And I'd feel like a better guy
'Cause nothing, nothing
Oh, nothing, no
I said, that nothing else would ever be the same

[Hook: Rex Orange County]
When we first spent the night
No, nothing else could ever feel that way
In my room it all changed, yeah

[Verse 1: Marco McKinnis]
Nothing seems to be as floral as you, baby
A scarlet love and dew-light touches were so sacred
I could never leave your face
Shower you with my warm embrace, baby

[Chorus: Rex Orange County]
And I still see that in your eyes
I hope that nothing will ever change
'Cause I wish that I could grow up, the way in which you grow up
'Cause then I'd love myself and I, I'd feel like a better guy
'Cause nothing, no, nothing
No, nothing, no
I said, that nothing else would ever be the same
Same, same, same (Be the same)

[Verse 2: Rex Orange County]
'Cause lately I've been missing you
And I just kinda want your body (I want it, baby)
I know I could ease the pain (Ease the pain)
And I know you done missed me too, and if that's true, well I'm sorry (I'm sorry)
But at least I'm on my feet again (I'm on my feet again)
But listen, girl
Couldn't you tell I'm scared as well?
You could hold my hand (Say something, say something)
Say something, something that could ease my pain
Ease my pain

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh



[Intro]
Oh
I want to know
Where I can go
When you're not around
And I'm feeling down
So won't you stay for a moment
So I can say
I, I need you so
'Cause right now you know that nothing here's new
And I'm obsessed with you
Then I fell to the ground
And you smiled at me and said

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna see you cry
You don't have to feel this emptiness
She said I love you till the day that I die
Well, maybe she's right
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me
And to be honest I don't even know why
I let myself get down in the first place

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes

[Verse 2]
You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream
A dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
I'm lucky to be me and you can see it in my face
Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place?

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down, down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes

[Bridge]
And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
Said I didn't need to get down or feel empty inside
And told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive
And well, maybe she's right
'Cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
See, I honestly don't even know why
I-I honestly don't even know why

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down, do-down-down
Diggy dig down, du du du du
Waiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes



[Verse 1]
Now there's no one left to blame
And your face stays the same
You're ashamed to say you feel relieved
Stay away from your own family

[Pre-Chorus]
But years from now
If you could make them proud
You could leave the world and feel like you've
Achieved the things you hoped to do, but
Honestly, I don't feel ordinary 'cause I haven't been at home in a while
Tell them that it's only temporary, I'm trying my best to smile

[Chorus]
But that's never enough
'Cause when you lose the ones you love
You might find it hard to cry
Until it's only you and everybody else has left the room
You might feel what it's like to not know how to feel

[Verse 2]
You see, my old lady's old man just now left
And there's nothing I can say except this long awaited rest
Is a good thing, and all good things must come to an end
It's right in front of me so there's no reason to pretend
Except, I'm afraid to die
If this were a movie, you'd be taking our kids to school
And I would be Channing Tatum or somebody sexy, somebody cool

[Pre-Chorus]
But years from now
If you could make them proud
You could leave the world and feel like you've
Achieved the things you hoped to do, cause
Honestly, I don't feel ordinary 'cause I haven't left my house in a while
Tell them that it's only temporary, I'm trying my best to smile

[Chorus]
But that's never enough
'Cause when you lose the ones you love
You might find it hard to cry
Until it's only you and everybody else has left the room
You might feel what it's like to not know how to feel

[Breakdown]
Don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
Well I could be the one to help
No, don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
I wanna be the one to help
No, don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
I wanna be the one to help
Don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
I wanna be the one to help
Don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
I wanna be the one to help
Don't tell me you're sorry
You're just sorry for yourself
And though you may seem fine alone
I hope to be the one to help



[Chorus]
Loving is easy
You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah, loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen, girl
When you can't even hide it
And it didn't take forever to find it
I was all on my own
Almost glad to be alone
Until love came in on time, on time

[Chorus]
So loving is easy
You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah, loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Ah, ah
Oh, oh
Ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
So listen, girl
When you can't even hide it
And it didn't take forever to find it
I was all on my own
Almost glad to be alone
Until love came in on time, oh, on time

[Chorus]
Loving is easy
You had me fucked up
It used to be so hard to see
Yeah, loving is easy
When everything's perfect
Please don't change a single little thing for me

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Ah, ah
Oh, oh
Ah, ah

","

[Verse 1]
'Cause baby there's something you know
But clearly you say, I'm not good for you
I think that I'm barely in love
You said you don't smoke, you do
Here's something I wrote for you
One time I had love for you

[Chorus]
'Cause honestly, you got me gone
From everyone

[Verse 2]
Stop you take my breath away
I'm so in love with you
Now just passing the time
Waiting longer for you
Oh baby ooh oooooh
And baby you know, that I
Never put it on, it was you, you

[Chorus]
'Cause honestly, you got me gone
From everyone



[Verse 1]
I don't mind, my head's in the sky
Thinkin' of you, oh, feelin' for you, oh oh
It's cold right now, I miss you for life
It's not going away, I thought I'd be okay, yeah

[Bridge]
I still think about the time
The time I spent just tryna grow with you
Baby, I was out of line
But you weren't there, you weren't there

[Chorus]
And oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying
I can't erase your picture from my head
Oh, maybe you took over my mind (You're fine)
I can't erase your picture from my head

[Verse 2]
I wish you weren't feeling so sad
I feel what you do, oh, I got that from you, oh oh
I shouldn't be so bothered by you
I'd probably be okay, if you just went away, yeah

[Bridge]
I still think about the time
The time I spent just tryna grow with you
Baby, I was out of line
But you weren't there, you weren't there

[Chorus]
Oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying
I can't erase your picture from my head
Oh, maybe you took over my mind (You're fine)
I can't erase your picture from my head

[Refrain]
I've been, I've been so guilty baby
I'm thinking about myself and I
What you, what you gon' feel me lately
I feel like I'm going out my way for you

[Chorus]
Oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying
I can't erase your picture from my head
Oh, maybe you took over my mind (You're fine)
I can't erase your picture from my head



[Verse 1]
I been away, but now I feel you, yeah
Wonder what made you feel like I could be the one, oh ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately, it's been me, I pissed you off
I let you in my feelings, you really feel, yeah
Uh huh, sayin'

[Chorus]
You been high, I get that
I been at the kickback
Nothing will content me
Doesn't matter, ah
Thought you came from nothin'
JDog, that’s my cousin
You should like my brother
Doesn't matter, ah

[Verse 2]
I've had a taste of how you feelin', yeah
Yeah, I've been hiding how I feel for way too long, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Lately it's been me, I pissed you off
I let you in my feelings, you really feel, yeah
Uh huh, sayin'

[Chorus]
You been high, I get that

Doesn't matter, ah



[Intro]
Don't need you in my life
It’s not that I don't love you, baby, huh
(It's not that I don’t love you, baby)
Can't think of what you want
I wish that I could show you, baby

[Verse 1]
Hey, easy come and easy go and talk too much
Making me really wanna come through, huh (Yeah, baby)

[Refrain]
I don't want to check, yeah
I just do my best, woo
Baddies to my left, huh
Goofy call the ref because I'm cooler than you

[Pre-Chorus]
Are, are you ashamed?
What are we supposed to do with our hearts?
Love is not a game
I'm just here protecting all that I are

[Chorus]
Don't need you in my life
It's not that I don't love you, baby, huh (Ow)
Can’t think of what you want
I wish that I could show you, baby (Ow)

[Verse 2]
Ah, Motorola, can’t control ya
Callin' home just to see if it’s gonna go through, huh (Yeah, babe)

[Refrain]
I don't want to check, yeah
I just do my best, woo
Baddies to my left, huh
Goofy call the ref because I'm cooler than you

[Pre-Chorus]
Are, are you ashamed?
What are we supposed to do with our hearts?
Love is not a game
I'm just here protecting all that I are

[Outro]
I will give you want you want, let’s finish what we started
Got me dancing in the dark, let's finish what we started
I can't get you off my mind (Mind)
And I will keep you satisfied (Satisfied)
Just look real deep into my eyes
Can't live without you by my side (Side)
I can't get you off my mind (Mind)
I will keep you satisfied (Satisfied)
Just look real deep into my eyes (Into my eyes)
Can't live without you by my side (You by my side)



[Verse 1]
Know you got a thing to do instead
But it's running away (Away)
Hold you to my heart and to my chest
Got me hurting my brain (My brain)

[Pre-Chorus]
Say it's obvious that I don't need your lovin', babe
(Baby, what'd you say?)
Why would I? Baby, what'd you say?
It's wrong and I need you, oh I

[Chorus]
And I want you all
For a minute
When did you turn so sensitive?
And I want you all
Baby, please
Why would you go and turn it down?
Yeah, everything you want
Is everything I need
So why you walk away?
This love is like a dream
But baby, turn around
You had me from the start
I'm losing all control
So go and break my heart

[Post-Chorus]
So good
So good

[Verse 2]
Took a couple months to get upset
Been avoiding the pain (The pain)
Maybe I should go and catch my breath
I've been tryna explain (Explain)

[Pre-Chorus]
Say it's obvious that I don't need your lovin', babe
(Baby, what'd you say?)
Why would I? Baby, what'd you say?
It's wrong and I need you, oh I

And I want you all
For a minute
When did you turn so sensitive?
And I want you all
Baby, please
Why would you go and turn it down?
Yeah, everything you want
Is everything I need
So why you walk away?
This love is like a dream
But baby, turn around
You had me from the start
I'm losing all control
So go and break my heart

[Post-Chorus]
So good
So good

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Yeah, everything you want
Is everything I need
So why you walk away?
This love is like a dream
But baby, turn around
You had me from the start
I'm losing all control
So go and break my heart

[Outro]
So good
So good
So good
So good
So good

[Chorus: Braeden]
Your way
I'm trying to understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it
Or if I'm wasting my time
Your way, or mine?

[Verse 1: Dylan]
You spend every second with him
You're taking what you're given
Your mother don't approve of the way that you've been living
She says he puts you through it
You shouldn't let him do it
And if there is a voice in your head, don't listen to it

[Verse 2: Braeden]
My mind is open wide
I think of it a thousand times
That empty space left in my bed from when you stayed the night
We were fucked up, but you still made sure I slept on my side
I still wake up wishing you're there when I open my eyes

[Chorus: Braeden]
Your way
I'm trying to understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it, or I'm wasting my time
Your way, or mine?

[Bridge: Dylan & Braeden]
Spend every second with him
You're taking what you're given
Your mother don't approve of the way that you've been living
She says he puts you through it
(My mind is open wide)
You shouldn't let him do it
(I think of it a thousand times)
And if there is a voice in your
(That empty space left in my)
Head don't listen to it

[Chorus: Braeden]
Your way
I'm trying to understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it
Or I'm wasting my time
Your way
Your way
I'm trying to understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it, or I'm wasting my time
Your way

[Outro: Braeden & Dylan]
Your way
I'm trying to understand these days
I need to know if you're feeling it
Or I'm wasting my time
Your way, or mine



[Verse 1: Dylan]
You're talking while you're fast asleep
As I walk slowly from your house
Back in your room remain the words I wanna say to you
But couldn't leave my mouth
Does it come as a surprise?
Language of averted eyes
Silence is what I do best

[Pre-Chorus: Dylan]
Still, I hear it all
Wasting time around my head
So I talk to myself instead

[Chorus: Braeden]
Sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how
It's something that I can't do
Then what am I supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only I could please her

[Verse 2: Braeden]
Indecisive feelings of enjoyment
Hold the thought, I think I need a moment
I'm aware there's somethin' I should tell you
But my voice annoys me
Bite my tongue off with a smile
I can't feel it anymore
'Cause recently the line is blurred
Between depression and bliss

[Pre-Chorus: Braeden]
Now I see that the times don't change
They waste away
But I just wanna sleep today
And I don't wanna talk to you right now
You say

[Chorus: Braeden]
But, I'm sitting out the weekend
Couldn't do it again
Say you want it right now
But I wouldn't know how
It's something that I can't do
Then what am I supposed to?
Quite the people pleaser
If only I could please her

[Bridge: Dylan & Braeden]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Outro: Dylan & Braeden]
I'm talking while you're next to me
Did I ruin the moment?
If I could tell you how I feel
Would you know what the words meant?
For sake of conversation
Could you read the writings on my sleeve?
'Cause that's the best you're gonna get
So maybe I had better leave



[Verse 1]
Thought I saw your shadow under the door
Just a trick of the light I've seen before
I can never tell what's real anymore
Anymore, anymore

[Verse 2]
I remember when we ran from the pool
All the decorations up in your room
And I couldn't find the right words to use
But I knew that you knew

[Pre-Chorus]
It's seemed so long, it's seemed so long
The moments that stay, they turn out all wrong
When I look around, you're gone

[Chorus 1]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
All the places I return to
All the faces that remind you

[Chorus 2]
I can still see you at the place I know when I close my eyes
Do you remember when we felt like the only two alive?
Don't let me be one of the people that seek a lost romance
Would you go and do it all over again, given the chance?

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh



[Verse 1]
Could I trust you with my thoughts
Or would you use them all against me
Can you replace my eyes for yours
And see what I really look like
I could help you criticize

[Chorus 1]
Looking for a sense of relation
Where do people want me to be?
I can't help but cry on vacation
Dressed to un-impress easily
Losing sight again
I'll go ahead and give your eyes back now

[Verse 2]
You grow up, gone
So what's the point of connecting to anyone?
Is a relationship bought or is it won?

[Chorus 2]
Are the things I think are important
Simply just distractions from death?
All of my ideas turn to content
They can be conceived 'til they're read
Lost my words again
It doesn't matter
'Cause you wouldn't understand

[Chorus 3]
Love in teens and life in the twenties
Nothing much to look forward to
I can't help but cry on vacation
Is this the way to exit my youth?
Oh

[Outro]
Hey, treacherous doctor, do you know what's the matter with me?
Hey, treacherous doctor, do you know what's the matter with me?



[Verse 1: Braeden]
New ways to spend all my time
Some's gone and some doesn't feel right
I need a new place to stay
And I don't think I'm gonna find it
You say you want, but never will
Just take it back and tell me no
It's easier to be alone
Than to be lied to

[Chorus: Braeden]
Why'd you waste all the time?
Back and forth in my mind
Clean it out, tell me now
Was it worth all the doubt?
You're not here with me, dear
Can we go through the years?
Take you there every night
Say that it's only right

[Verse 2: Dylan]
White noise that plays in my head
Try to recall the words you said
Can you slip into my dreams?
And then I'll never wanna wake up
I hear you talk when you're not there
It comes at me from everywhere
Oh, can you lose the rest of me
And take my mind away?

[Chorus: Braeden]
Why'd you waste all the time
Back and forth in my mind
Clean it out, tell me now
Was it worth all the doubt?
You're not here, with me dear
Can we go, through the years?
Take you there, every night
Say that it's only right

[Bridge: Dylan & Braeden]
I'm wide awake, it feels like all the time
I need to know if it'll be alright
I'm waiting on another day to fall
When you're awake to hear my call
'Cause it's open
I'm wide awake, it feels like all the time (My door is open)
I need to know if it'll be alright
(Please let me know when)
I'm waiting on another day to fall  (You're coming home)
When you're awake to hear my call

[Chorus: Braeden]
Why'd you waste all the time
Back and forth in my mind
Clean it out, tell me now
Was it worth all the doubt?
You're not here, with me dear
Can we go, through the years?
Take you there, every night
Say that it's only right

","

[Verse 1]
I don't know if we should be alone together
I still got a crush, that's obvious
If nobody's around, what's stopping us?
Everywhere I go you show whatever
I don't ever mind sharing oxygen
I just wanna get lost in your lungs

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Just a baby, but she's growing up so fast
And I'm allergic to the waiting
She's just a baby girl
And I love to watch her dance
But it's making me go crazy

[Chorus]
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?

[Verse 2]
I don't think that we should be around each other
When you're in the room, you get my eyes
You open your mouth, I'm hypnotized
I can make you laugh until you cry
You know you got all my attention
You know you got all mine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
""Baby,"" I can't help but call her that
Even though I shouldn't say it
She was my baby girl
Might never get her back
But I don't mind being patient, yeah

[Chorus]
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?

[Bridge]
Okay
I'm just gonna tell you what I gotta say
Right here
I'm sorry Dave, I never meant to hurt your baby girl
She's your little baby, she's my soulmate
I don't want you to worry, she'll be so safe right here
Oh, so
Dave, would you let your baby be my girl?

[Chorus]
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be my girl?
Can you let your baby be mine?
Your baby, she's mine

","

[Verse 1]
Don't do love, don't do friends
I'm only after success
Don't need a relationship
I'll never soften my grip

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't want cash, don't want card
Want it fast, want it hard
Don't need money, don't need fame
I just want to make a change
I just wanna change, I just wanna change
I just wanna change, I just wanna change
I just wanna... change

[Chorus]
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!

[Verse 2]
One track mind, one track heart
If I fail, I'll fall apart
Maybe it is all a test
'Cause I feel like I'm the worst
So I always act like I'm the best

[Pre-Chorus]
If you are not very careful
Your possessions will possess you
TV taught me how to feel
Now real life has no appeal
It has no appeal, it has no appeal
It has no appeal, it has no appeal
It has no appeal

[Chorus]
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!

[Bridge]
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fail, I'm gonna die
I'm gonna live, I'm gonna fly
I'm gonna fail, gonna die, die, die, die

[Chorus]
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!
I know exactly what I want and who I want to be
I know exactly why I walk and talk like a machine
I'm now becoming my own self-fulfilled prophecy
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!

[Outro]
Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no, oh!



[Verse 1]
The pagodas and the palaces
Dressed in gold leaf, hide the damages
Spot the Geisha as she balances
Life's a cakewalk, full of challenges
Go to Russia, see the Red Square
Lenin's body lying dead there
From Kyoto, Hiroshima
Watch the black cloud crawling nearer

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There were riots in America
Just when things were getting better
All the things I've done and seen
Still I don't know what life means

[Chorus]
All the people living in, living in the world today
We're united by our love, we're united by our pain (Ooh)
All the things that I've done and I've seen
Still, I don't know, don't know what it means

[Verse 2]
Fly to Athens, pass the Parthenon
See the village where my father's from
To Chicago from Angola
São Paulo to Verona

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And anywhere you go, you'll see (Ooh)
People are just like you and me (Ooh)
All the things I've done and seen
Still, I don't know what life means

[Chorus]
All the people living in, living in the world today
We're united by our love, we're united by our pain (Ooh)
All the things that I've done and I've seen
Still, I don't know, don't know what it means
To be human
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Still, I don't know, don't know what it means
To be human, a real human being

[Bridge]
I like to think about how we all look from afar
People driving fancy cars look like beetles to the stars
The missiles and the bombs sound like symphonies gone wrong
And if there is a God, they'll know why it's so hard

[Chorus]
To be human
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
To be human
Still, I don't know, don't know what it means
To be human, a real human being

[Outro]
(To be human)
I want connection, ooh
I wanna feel human again
(To be human)
Lost my direction, ooh
I wanna feel human again
To be human, to be human
To be human, to be human



[Intro]
American queen is the American dream
American queen is the American dream

[Verse 1]
She is a Polish girl in America
Tall, tanned, hot blonde called Anya
I asked her, ""Why would you wanna be a Hollywood wife?""
""Because I don't want to end up living in a dive on Vine""

[Verse 2]
Air hostesses doing gossip magazine
Crosswords on a flight to JFK
Thirty-nine years old with a mile-high sheen
Trying to stimulate a mind
That is slowly starting to decay

[Pre-Chorus]
I itch my skin, I jump up and say
""Lady, I know why your thoughts turn grey""

[Alternative Pre-Chorus]
You'd do anything for a dime
You're looking for the golden light

[Chorus]
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh
Living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America, ooh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America

[Verse 3]
A fat security making plays for me
Soon as I touch down in old L.A
He said, ""Oh, my god, you look just like Shakira
No, no, you're Catherine Zeta!""
""Actually, my name's Marina""

[Pre-Chorus]
Your mind is just like mine
All filled up with things benign
You're looking for the golden light

[Chorus]
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America, ooh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America

[Bridge]
American dream is the American queen
American queen is the American dream
Is the American dream

[Chorus]
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
Hollywood infected your brain
You wanted kissing in the rain, oh, oh
I've been living in a movie scene
Puking American dreams, oh, oh
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America, ooh-hoo
I'm obsessed with the mess that's America



[Verse 1]
Used to be a major scale
But the melody went stale
Musical cacophony let
Insy winsy spider free
You're a rich little boy
Who's had to work for his toys
You've got all the sensibilities, oh
Of an upper class guy

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no, I'm not your little slave
No, I don't twist and turn that way
Only got bad things to say
You're always asking what is up, up with me

[Chorus]
Could never tell you what happened
The day I turned seventeen
The rise of a king and the fall of a queen, oh
Seventeen
Seventeen

[Verse 2]
Oh, you were embarrassed of me
'Cause I used my tongue freely
Bet you wish I couldn't speak, 'cause when I do
You know I tell you why you appear weak
You want a hassle-free life?
Go get your upper class wife
Oh, she's got all the personality, oh
Of a lemon that has been
Truly sucked dry

[Pre-Chorus]
You teach me how to behave
I felt you question the way
I was brought up as a baby
Well, you don't know fuck about my family

[Chorus]
Could never tell you what happened
The day I turned seventeen
The rise of a king and the fall of a queen, oh
Seventeen (seventeen)
Oh, seventeen
Oh, seventeen
The rise of a king and the fall of a queen, oh
Seventeen

[Outro]
Never felt like a princess
I used to kill myself in this dress
That it was just how things
Were meant to be
Oh, seventeen
Seventeen



[Intro]
Froo-oo-oo-oot
La-la-la-la-la-la
Ju-u-u-uice
La-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
I've seen seasons come and go
From winter sun to summer snow
This ain't my first time at the rodeo

[Verse 2]
Nature ain't a fruit machine
She's gotta keep her credits clean
Good things come to those who wait
But I ain't in a patient phase

[Interlude 1]
It's summer time and I hang on the vine
They're gonna make me into sweet red wine
Hanging around like a fruit on a tree
Waiting to be picked, come on cut me free

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Come on fill your cup up
Looking for some good luck
Good luck, good luck to you
Hanging like a fruit
Ready to be juiced
Juiced, juiced

[Chorus]
Living la dolce vita
Life couldn't get much sweeter
Don't you give me a reason
That it's not the right season
Babe, I love you a lot
I'll give you all I've got
Yeah, you know that it's true
I've been saving all my summers for you
I've been saving all my summers for you
Like froot, like froot

[Verse 3]
Baby, I am plump and ripe
I'm pinker than shepherd's delight
Sweet like honeysuckle late at night

[Verse 4]
Leave it too long I'll go rot
Like an apple you forgot
Birds and worms will come for me
The cycle of life is complete

[Interlude 2]
I'm your carnal flower, I'm your bloody rose
Pick my petals off and make my heart explode
I'm your deadly nightshade, I'm your cherry tree
You're my one true love, I'm your destiny

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Come on fill your cup up
Looking for some good luck
Good luck, good luck to you
Autumn, I'll be gone
Birds will sing their mourning song
Song

[Chorus]
Living la dolce vita
Life couldn't get much sweeter
Don't you give me a reason
That it's not the right season
Babe, I love you a lot
I'll give you all I've got
Yeah, you know that it's true
I've been saving all my summers for you
I've been saving all my summers for you
Like froot, like froot

[Bridge]
Oh my body is ready
Yeah it's ready, yeah it's ready for your love
Oh my branches are heavy
Yeah they're heavy, yeah they're heavy

[Chorus]
Living la dolce vita
Life couldn't get much sweeter
Don't you give me a reason
That it's not the right season
Babe, I love you a lot
I'll give you all I've got
Yeah, you know that it's true
I've been saving all my summers for you
I've been saving all my summers for you
Like froot, like froot

[Outro]
Living la dolce vita
I'm in love
Living la dolce vita
I'm in love
I'm in love
