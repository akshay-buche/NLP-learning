beside me\\nDon’t call me daddy\\nCause that’s just fucking weird\\nPromise that you'll stay here\\nYou and I can lay here\\nUntil the end of time\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nBut girl, well don't you worry about me\\nIt ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely (Darling)\\nGirl, don't worry about me\\nBut if you’re ever unhappy\\nThen maybe, baby, I must let you go\\nLet you go\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nBaby, now it’s best here, to lay me down and rest here\\nLet’s dream of Corduroy\\nWork for what you love to do and I will watch right over you\\nWith your heart, I’ll never toy\\nAnd you’re the other half of me\\nDrink and sleep and laugh with me\\nSave me from myself\\nSee I’m a fucking basket-case\\nUntil I'm able to see your face\\nYou saved me from myself\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nBut girl, don't worry about me\\nCause it ain't new to me, feeling this lonely\\nDarling baby, girl, don't worry about me\\nCause if you're ever unhappy, if you’re ever unhappy\\nIf you’re ever, ever unhappy\\nThen maybe, maybe baby I must let you go\\n\\n\\n\\n[Intro]\\nAy\\n\\n[Hook: Rex Orange County]\\nWhen we first spent the night\\nNothing else would ever feel that way\\nIn my room it all changed\\n\\n[Chorus: Rex Orange County]\\nAnd I could see something in your eyes\\nI knew that nothing else would be the same\\nBut I wish that I could grow up, the way in which you grow up\\n'Cause then you'd never see me cry\\nAnd I'd feel like a better guy\\n'Cause nothing, nothing\\nOh, nothing, no\\nI said, that nothing else would ever be the same\\n\\n[Hook: Rex Orange County]\\nWhen we first spent the night\\nNo, nothing else could ever feel that way\\nIn my room it all changed, yeah\\n\\n[Verse 1: Marco McKinnis]\\nNothing seems to be as floral as you, baby\\nA scarlet love and dew-light touches were so sacred\\nI could never leave your face\\nShower you with my warm embrace, baby\\n\\n[Chorus: Rex Orange County]\\nAnd I still see that in your eyes\\nI hope that nothing will ever change\\n'Cause I wish that I could grow up, the way in which you grow up\\n'Cause then I'd love myself and I, I'd feel like a better guy\\n'Cause nothing, no, nothing\\nNo, nothing, no\\nI said, that nothing else would ever be the same\\nSame, same, same (Be the same)\\n\\n[Verse 2: Rex Orange County]\\n'Cause lately I've been missing you\\nAnd I just kinda want your body (I want it, baby)\\nI know I could ease the pain (Ease the pain)\\nAnd I know you done missed me too, and if that's true, well I'm sorry (I'm sorry)\\nBut at least I'm on my feet again (I'm on my feet again)\\nBut listen, girl\\nCouldn't you tell I'm scared as well?\\nYou could hold my hand (Say something, say something)\\nSay something, something that could ease my pain\\nEase my pain\\n\\n[Outro]\\nOoh, ooh\\n\\n\\n\\n[Intro]\\nOh\\nI want to know\\nWhere I can go\\nWhen you're not around\\nAnd I'm feeling down\\nSo won't you stay for a moment\\nSo I can say\\nI, I need you so\\n'Cause right now you know that nothing here's new\\nAnd I'm obsessed with you\\nThen I fell to the ground\\nAnd you smiled at me and said\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\nI don't wanna see you cry\\nYou don't have to feel this emptiness\\nShe said I love you till the day that I die\\nWell, maybe she's right\\n'Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me\\nAnd to be honest I don't even know why\\nI let myself get down in the first place\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nTryna keep my mind at bay\\nSunflower still grows at night\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\nMake it down down, do-down-down\\nDiggy dig down, du du du du\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nYou know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream\\nA dream of you and I\\nThere's no need to keep an open eye\\nI promise I'm the one for you\\nJust let me hold you in these arms tonight\\nI'm lucky to be me and you can see it in my face\\nBack when I fucked my shit up too many times\\nWhy would I let myself get down in the first place?\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nTryna keep my mind at bay\\nSunflower still grows at night\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\nMake it down, down, do-down-down\\nDiggy dig down, du du du du\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nAnd so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry\\nSaid I didn't need to get down or feel empty inside\\nAnd told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive\\nAnd well, maybe she's right\\n'Cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me\\nSee, I honestly don't even know why\\nI-I honestly don't even know why\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nTryna keep my mind at bay\\nSunflower still grows at night\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\nMake it down down, do-down-down\\nDiggy dig down, du du du du\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\n\\n\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\nNow there's no one left to blame\\nAnd your face stays the same\\nYou're ashamed to say you feel relieved\\nStay away from your own family\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nBut years from now\\nIf you could make them proud\\nYou could leave the world and feel like you've\\nAchieved the things you hoped to do, but\\nHonestly, I don't feel ordinary 'cause I haven't been at home in a while\\nTell them that it's only temporary, I'm trying my best to smile\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nBut that's never enough\\n'Cause when you lose the ones you love\\nYou might find it hard to cry\\nUntil it's only you and everybody else has left the room\\nYou might feel what it's like to not know how to feel\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nYou see, my old lady's old man just now left\\nAnd there's nothing I can say except this long awaited rest\\nIs a good thing, and all good things must come to an end\\nIt's right in front of me so there's no reason to pretend\\nExcept, I'm afraid to die\\nIf this were a movie, you'd be taking our kids to school\\nAnd I would be Channing Tatum or somebody sexy, somebody cool\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nBut years from now\\nIf you could make them proud\\nYou could leave the world and feel like you've\\nAchieved the things you hoped to do, cause\\nHonestly, I don't feel ordinary 'cause I haven't left my house in a while\\nTell them that it's only temporary, I'm trying my best to smile\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nBut that's never enough\\n'Cause when you lose the ones you love\\nYou might find it hard to cry\\nUntil it's only you and everybody else has left the room\\nYou might feel what it's like to not know how to feel\\n\\n[Breakdown]\\nDon't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nWell I could be the one to help\\nNo, don't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nI wanna be the one to help\\nNo, don't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nI wanna be the one to help\\nDon't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nI wanna be the one to help\\nDon't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nI wanna be the one to help\\nDon't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nI hope to be the one to help\\n\\n\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nLoving is easy\\nYou had me fucked up\\nIt used to be so hard to see\\nYeah, loving is easy\\nWhen everything's perfect\\nPlease don't change a single little thing for me\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nListen, girl\\nWhen you can't even hide it\\nAnd it didn't take forever to find it\\nI was all on my own\\nAlmost glad to be alone\\nUntil love came in on time, on time\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nSo loving is easy\\nYou had me fucked up\\nIt used to be so hard to see\\nYeah, loving is easy\\nWhen everything's perfect\\nPlease don't change a single little thing for me\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nOh, oh\\nAh, ah\\nOh, oh\\nAh, ah\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nSo listen, girl\\nWhen you can't even hide it\\nAnd it didn't take forever to find it\\nI was all on my own\\nAlmost glad to be alone\\nUntil love came in on time, oh, on time\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nLoving is easy\\nYou had me fucked up\\nIt used to

him\\nYou're taking what you're given\\nYour mother don't approve of the way that you've been living\\nShe says he puts you through it\\nYou shouldn't let him do it\\nAnd if there is a voice in your head, don't listen to it\\n\\n[Verse 2: Braeden]\\nMy mind is open wide\\nI think of it a thousand times\\nThat empty space left in my bed from when you stayed the night\\nWe were fucked up, but you still made sure I slept on my side\\nI still wake up wishing you're there when I open my eyes\\n\\n[Chorus: Braeden]\\nYour way\\nI'm trying to understand these days\\nI need to know if you're feeling

words I wanna say to you\\nBut couldn't leave my mouth\\nDoes it come as a surprise?\\nLanguage of averted eyes\\nSilence is what I do best\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus: Dylan]\\nStill, I hear it all\\nWasting time around my head\\nSo I talk to myself instead\\n\\n[Chorus: Braeden]\\nSitting out the weekend\\nCouldn't do it again\\nSay you want it right now\\nBut I wouldn't know how\\nIt's something that I can't do\\nThen what am I supposed to?\\nQuite the people pleaser\\nIf only I could please her\\n\\n[Verse 2: Braeden]\\nIndecisive feelings of enjoyment\\nHold the thought, I think I need a moment\\nI'm aware there's somethin' I should tell you\\nBut my voice annoys me\\nBite my tongue off with a smile\\nI can't feel it anymore\\n'Cause recently the line is blurred\\nBetween depression

that's the best you're gonna get\\nSo maybe I had better leave\\n\\n\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\nThought I saw your shadow under the door\\nJust a trick of the light I've seen before\\nI can never tell what's real anymore\\nAnymore, anymore\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nI remember when we ran from the pool\\nAll the decorations up in your room\\nAnd I couldn't find the right words to use\\nBut I knew that you knew\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nIt's seemed so long, it's seemed so long\\nThe moments that stay, they turn out all wrong\\nWhen I look around, you're gone\\n\\n[Chorus 1]\\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nAll the places I return to\\nAll the faces that remind you\\n\\n[Chorus 2]\\nI can still see you at the place I know when I close my eyes\\nDo you remember when we felt like the only two alive?\\nDon't let me be one of the people that seek a lost romance\\nWould you go and do it all over again, given the chance?\\n\\n[Outro]\\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\\nOh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\\n\\n\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\nCould I trust you with my thoughts\\nOr would you use them all against me\\nCan you replace my eyes for yours\\nAnd see what I really look like\\nI could help you criticize\\n\\n[Chorus 1]\\nLooking for a sense of relation\\nWhere do people want me to be?\\nI can't help but cry on vacation\\nDressed to un-impress easily\\nLosing sight again\\nI'll go ahead and give your eyes back now\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nYou grow up, gone\\nSo what's the point of connecting to anyone?\\nIs a relationship bought or is it won?\\n\\n[Chorus 2]\\nAre the things I think are important\\nSimply just distractions from death?\\nAll of my ideas turn to content\\nThey can be conceived 'til they're read\\nLost my words again\\nIt doesn't matter\\n'Cause you wouldn't understand\\n\\n[Chorus 3]\\nLove in teens and life in the twenties\\nNothing much to look forward to\\nI can't help but cry on vacation\\nIs this the way to exit my youth?\\nOh\\n\\n[Outro]\\nHey, treacherous doctor, do you know what's the matter with me?\\nHey, treacherous doctor, do you know what's the matter with me?\\n\\n\\n\\n[Verse 1: Braeden]\\nNew ways to spend all my time\\nSome's gone and some doesn't feel right\\nI need a new place to stay\\nAnd I don't think I'm gonna find it\\nYou say you want, but never will\\nJust take it back and tell me no\\nIt's easier to be alone\\nThan to be lied to\\n\\n[Chorus: Braeden]\\nWhy'd you waste all the time?\\nBack and forth in my mind\\nClean it out, tell me now\\nWas it worth all the doubt?\\nYou're not here with me, dear\\nCan we go through the years?\\nTake you there every night\\nSay that it's only right\\n\\n[Verse 2: Dylan]\\nWhite noise that plays in my head\\nTry to recall

beside me\\nDon’t call me daddy\\nCause that’s just fucking weird\\nPromise that you'll stay here\\nYou and I can lay here\\nUntil the end of time\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nBut girl, well don't you worry about me\\nIt ain’t new to me, feeling this lonely (Darling)\\nGirl, don't worry about me\\nBut if you’re ever unhappy\\nThen maybe, baby, I must let you go\\nLet you go\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nBaby, now it’s best here, to lay me down and rest here\\nLet’s dream of Corduroy\\nWork for what you love to do and I will watch right over you\\nWith your heart, I’ll never toy\\nAnd you’re the other half of me\\nDrink and sleep and laugh with me\\nSave me from myself\\nSee I’m a fucking basket-case\\nUntil I'm able to see your face\\nYou saved me from myself\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nBut girl, don't worry about me\\nCause it ain't new to me, feeling this lonely\\nDarling baby, girl, don't worry about me\\nCause if you're ever unhappy, if you’re ever unhappy\\nIf you’re ever, ever unhappy\\nThen maybe, maybe baby I must let you go\\n\\n\\n\\n[Intro]\\nAy\\n\\n[Hook: Rex Orange County]\\nWhen we first spent the night\\nNothing else would ever feel that way\\nIn my room it all changed\\n\\n[Chorus: Rex Orange County]\\nAnd I could see something in your eyes\\nI knew that nothing else would be the same\\nBut I wish that I could grow up, the way in which you grow up\\n'Cause then you'd never see me cry\\nAnd I'd feel like a better guy\\n'Cause nothing, nothing\\nOh, nothing, no\\nI said, that nothing else would ever be the same\\n\\n[Hook: Rex Orange County]\\nWhen we first spent the night\\nNo, nothing else could ever feel that way\\nIn my room it all changed, yeah\\n\\n[Verse 1: Marco McKinnis]\\nNothing seems to be as floral as you, baby\\nA scarlet love and dew-light touches were so sacred\\nI could never leave your face\\nShower you with my warm embrace, baby\\n\\n[Chorus: Rex Orange County]\\nAnd I still see that in your eyes\\nI hope that nothing will ever change\\n'Cause I wish that I could grow up, the way in which you grow up\\n'Cause then I'd love myself and I, I'd feel like a better guy\\n'Cause nothing, no, nothing\\nNo, nothing, no\\nI said, that nothing else would ever be the same\\nSame, same, same (Be the same)\\n\\n[Verse 2: Rex Orange County]\\n'Cause lately I've been missing you\\nAnd I just kinda want your body (I want it, baby)\\nI know I could ease the pain (Ease the pain)\\nAnd I know you done missed me too, and if that's true, well I'm sorry (I'm sorry)\\nBut at least I'm on my feet again (I'm on my feet again)\\nBut listen, girl\\nCouldn't you tell I'm scared as well?\\nYou could hold my hand (Say something, say something)\\nSay something, something that could ease my pain\\nEase my pain\\n\\n[Outro]\\nOoh, ooh\\n\\n\\n\\n[Intro]\\nOh\\nI want to know\\nWhere I can go\\nWhen you're not around\\nAnd I'm feeling down\\nSo won't you stay for a moment\\nSo I can say\\nI, I need you so\\n'Cause right now you know that nothing here's new\\nAnd I'm obsessed with you\\nThen I fell to the ground\\nAnd you smiled at me and said\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\nI don't wanna see you cry\\nYou don't have to feel this emptiness\\nShe said I love you till the day that I die\\nWell, maybe she's right\\n'Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me\\nAnd to be honest I don't even know why\\nI let myself get down in the first place\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nTryna keep my mind at bay\\nSunflower still grows at night\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\nMake it down down, do-down-down\\nDiggy dig down, du du du du\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nYou know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream\\nA dream of you and I\\nThere's no need to keep an open eye\\nI promise I'm the one for you\\nJust let me hold you in these arms tonight\\nI'm lucky to be me and you can see it in my face\\nBack when I fucked my shit up too many times\\nWhy would I let myself get down in the first place?\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nTryna keep my mind at bay\\nSunflower still grows at night\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\nMake it down, down, do-down-down\\nDiggy dig down, du du du du\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nAnd so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry\\nSaid I didn't need to get down or feel empty inside\\nAnd told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive\\nAnd well, maybe she's right\\n'Cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me\\nSee, I honestly don't even know why\\nI-I honestly don't even know why\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nTryna keep my mind at bay\\nSunflower still grows at night\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\nMake it down down, do-down-down\\nDiggy dig down, du du du du\\nWaiting for a minute 'til the sun's seen through my eyes\\n\\n\\n\\n[Verse 1]\\nNow there's no one left to blame\\nAnd your face stays the same\\nYou're ashamed to say you feel relieved\\nStay away from your own family\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nBut years from now\\nIf you could make them proud\\nYou could leave the world and feel like you've\\nAchieved the things you hoped to do, but\\nHonestly, I don't feel ordinary 'cause I haven't been at home in a while\\nTell them that it's only temporary, I'm trying my best to smile\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nBut that's never enough\\n'Cause when you lose the ones you love\\nYou might find it hard to cry\\nUntil it's only you and everybody else has left the room\\nYou might feel what it's like to not know how to feel\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nYou see, my old lady's old man just now left\\nAnd there's nothing I can say except this long awaited rest\\nIs a good thing, and all good things must come to an end\\nIt's right in front of me so there's no reason to pretend\\nExcept, I'm afraid to die\\nIf this were a movie, you'd be taking our kids to school\\nAnd I would be Channing Tatum or somebody sexy, somebody cool\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nBut years from now\\nIf you could make them proud\\nYou could leave the world and feel like you've\\nAchieved the things you hoped to do, cause\\nHonestly, I don't feel ordinary 'cause I haven't left my house in a while\\nTell them that it's only temporary, I'm trying my best to smile\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nBut that's never enough\\n'Cause when you lose the ones you love\\nYou might find it hard to cry\\nUntil it's only you and everybody else has left the room\\nYou might feel what it's like to not know how to feel\\n\\n[Breakdown]\\nDon't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nWell I could be the one to help\\nNo, don't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nI wanna be the one to help\\nNo, don't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nI wanna be the one to help\\nDon't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nI wanna be the one to help\\nDon't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nI wanna be the one to help\\nDon't tell me you're sorry\\nYou're just sorry for yourself\\nAnd though you may seem fine alone\\nI hope to be the one to help\\n\\n\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nLoving is easy\\nYou had me fucked up\\nIt used to be so hard to see\\nYeah, loving is easy\\nWhen everything's perfect\\nPlease don't change a single little thing for me\\n\\n[Pre-Chorus]\\nListen, girl\\nWhen you can't even hide it\\nAnd it didn't take forever to find it\\nI was all on my own\\nAlmost glad to be alone\\nUntil love came in on time, on time\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nSo loving is easy\\nYou had me fucked up\\nIt used to be so hard to see\\nYeah, loving is
